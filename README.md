This is the latest verion of the tanks game, made arround the entire semester, the game consist in a couple of tanks
shooting each other, the idea of the game is that, you set an amount of rounds to play, and then, the players have to buy their ammunition
to play the rounds, if all tanks are empy of bullets, the round ends, on the other hand, if there one last player in the game, the round closes too. 
This game can support, resize of the screen, different map conditions, like wind or gravity, visual interface and the posibility to play with the cpu or local friends.
